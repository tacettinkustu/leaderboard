# Microverse Leaderboard

* The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

## How to build the leaderboard website

* For this application the priority is to create a working version of the leaderboard that preserves user input. I built a website according to the wireframe:

![wireframe](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/raw/main/leaderboard/images/leaderboard_wireframe.png)

* Then, I will connect to the Leaderboard API (as described in its documentation) in order to implement the actions behind the "Refresh" and "Submit" buttons. In the last step, you will play with async & await and add as much styling as possible in the given time.

* It is built as a part of Microverse Web Developer Course. ES6 and Webpack template was used in this project.

## Projects List

* I will be building the leaderboard website during the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide me through the steps described above. I will find details about each of the milestone requirements in the upcoming program activities.
